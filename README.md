A broken webpage that is intended to hit a firebase database and update scheduled trains and keep track of arrival times via moment.js.
~~working pieces
-clock that updates the current local time and displays at the top of the page
-firebase database updated with new train entry when user fills in input fields and hits submit
-table updated with user input text (not firebase entry unfortunately)
~~to be fixed later~~
-moment.js needed to track arrival time property of trains being tracked
-add status element that tracks whether a train has arrived or is in-transit
-train objects from firebase need to display on page (childAdded function? couldn't figure out syntax)
-fancier styling
